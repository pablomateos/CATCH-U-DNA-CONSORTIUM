# CATCH-U-DNA-CONSORTIUM

Data Management Plan (DMP) for the proyect “Capturing non-Amplified Tumor Circulating DNA with Ultrasound Hydrodynamics” project (Contract No 737212) in the framework of the H2020-FETOPEN Program. It is addressed to the members of the CATCH-U-DNA Consortium, and aims to provide a initial version of the protocol to save data and create a database of the different work loads of the project.   

The present database has two purposes  

1) A tool to faciliate contact between partners and provide easy access to global and particular information of the different work-packages of CATCH-U-DNA.  

2) A selection of the database will be made open in a public repository (publications, data from publications, selected experiments assays and selected source codes for analysis and simulations).
